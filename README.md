This repository is about telecom projects I have worked on and figured out. Specifically

1. "Modified Decision Based Median Filter for Impulse Noise Removal"
   Recreation of paper with the above title on MATLAB. Implemented all the filters mentioned in paper. Created the exact figures and a        mini report is included.

2. "DTMF Tone"
   Matlab script that demonstrates the encoding and the decoding of a DTMF tone.
   
3. "Sensor Network"
   Matlab script that places randomly N nodes and 4 sink nodes in space. Then, it finds the hops needed for all nodes to connect to the      closest sink node. After this, we try to minimize the hops, by optmally placing the nodes.
   
4. "MAC Protocol"
   Implementation of MAC protocol '1-persistent CSMA/CD with Binary Exponential Backoff'.

5. "MarkovHuffman"
   Huffman coding and decoding for a Markov chain.
