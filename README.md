      Modified Decision Based Median Filter for Impulse Noise Removal
      <br>
      Recreation of paper with the title above on MATLAB. Implemented all the filters mentioned in paper. Created the exact figures and a mini report is included. Developed in the context of freelancing.

      DTMF Tone
      <br>
      Matlab script that demonstrates the encoding and the decoding of a DTMF tone. Developed in the context of freelancing.

   <li>
      Sensor Network
      <br>
      Matlab script that places randomly N nodes and 4 sink nodes in space. Then, it finds the hops needed for all nodes to connect to the closest sink node. After this, we try to minimize the hops, by optmally placing the nodes. Developed in the context of freelancing.

      MAC Protocol
      <br>
      Implementation of MAC protocol '1-persistent CSMA/CD with Binary Exponential Backoff'. Developed in the context of freelancing.

      Markov Huffman
      <br>
      Huffman coding and decoding for a Markov chain. Developed for a school project.
   </li>

      Angle Estimation
      <br>
      Estimation of angles of 5 sourses using MF, ZF, MUSIC and ESPIRIT filters. Developed for a school project.
   </li>

      PAM
      <br>
      Simulation of 2-PAM and 4-PAM modulations. Developed for a school project.
   </li>
   <li>
      PSK-8
      <br>
      Simulations of 8-PSK modulation. Developed for a school project.
